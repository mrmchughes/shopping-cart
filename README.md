<h1>Shopping Cart</h1>

<p>I developed this React app as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/shopping-cart) Fullstack curriculum. This project was another milestone for me, as it utilized react-router-dom, letting me build a website with multiple pages.</p>

<p>The app I developed is a Shopping Cart for a fake Gaming store, with separate Home, Store, and Cart pages to practice routing. On the top of all of the pages is a persistent Navbar, which allows for users to click a link and go to one of the other pages. On the Shop page, when a user clicks on a product, it is added to the cart. The total number of products in the Cart is displayed next to the link to the cart page in the Navbar. At the bottom of the cart is a fake checkout button, which alerts a message thanking the user for looking at the site.
