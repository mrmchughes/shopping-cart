<h1>Shopping Cart</h1>

<p>I developed this React app as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/shopping-cart) Fullstack curriculum. This project was another milestone for me, as it utilized react-router-dom.</p>

<p>I developed a Shopping Cart for a fake store, with a Home Page, and a Store Page, to practice routing. On the top of both pages is a persistent Navbar, which allows for users to click a link and go to a different page. Additionally, the Navbar contains a button to toggle the visibility of the cart when clicked. On the Shop page, when a user clicks on a product, it is added to the cart, and the total quantity in the cart is updated in the Navbar. At the bottom of the cart is a fake checkout button, which alerts a message thanking the user for looking at the site.
